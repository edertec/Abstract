Forecasting incidents caused by various activities and determining the root cause might aid in implementing appropriate interventions. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the future trend and identify the pattern of contributing factors of incident occurrences. The study focuses on an integrated steel plant where different steel-making-related operations are carried out in separate units. The incident data of 45 months is used. Initially, a unit-wise trend of incidents (e.g., injury, near-miss and property damage) is forecasted using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to determine the near-future incident trends and to identify the most incident-prone unit of the plant. The model is validated using six-month holdout data, and the predicted number of incidents is compared with the actual counts. The ARIMA model indicates that the safety performance of the iron making unit is found to be underperforming. In the second phase, meaningful association rules are extracted from text data using the apriori algorithm for the underperforming unit to discover the incident-causing factors. Results from text mining-based association mining suggest that bike and car-related incidents are the leading causes of injury. Similarly, gas leakage, slag spillage, and coke-oven door malfunctioning are causing near-miss incidents. The majority of property damage incidents are reported due to derailment, loading/ unloading and dashing of the dumper vehicle.

High-precision classification of construction accident narratives is a laborious, time-consuming process that requires substantial domain expertise. However, automatic text classification had fallen short of expectations due to a lack of high-quality data sets, inadequate semantic interpretation, and primitive model architecture. To address these issues, this study developed a state-of-the-art text classification (TC) model to extract construction knowledge and classify construction accident narratives into predefined categories.

44,Automatic classification of construction safety reports using semi-supervised YAKE-Guided LDA approach,"Gadekar, Hrishikesh and Bugalia, Nikhil",Literature on supervised Machine-Learning (ML) approaches for classifying text-based safety reports for the construction sector has been growing. Rece,Problem described in context,Data described in abstract,Methods described in abstract,Results summarized from abstract,"Literature on supervised Machine-Learning (ML) approaches for classifying text-based safety reports for the construction sector has been growing. Recent studies have emphasized the need to build ML approaches that balance high classification accuracy and performance on management criteria, such as resource intensiveness. However, despite being highly accurate, the extensively focused, supervised ML approaches may not perform well on management criteria as many factors contribute to their resource intensiveness. Alternatively, the potential for semi-supervised ML approaches to achieve balanced performance has rarely been explored in the construction safety literature. The current study contributes to the scarce knowledge on semi-supervised ML approaches by demonstrating the applicability of a state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approach, i.e., Yet, Another Keyword Extractor (YAKE) integrated with Guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation (GLDA) for construction safety report classification. Construction-safety-specific knowledge is extracted as keywords through YAKE, relying on accessible literature with minimal manual intervention. Keywords from YAKE are then seeded in the GLDA model for the automatic classification of safety reports without requiring a large quantity of prelabeled datasets. The YAKE-GLDA classification performance (F1 score of 0.66) is superior to existing unsupervised methods for the benchmark data containing injury narratives from Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA). The YAKE-GLDA approach is also applied to near-miss safety reports from a construction site.

This study aims to use a machine learning (ML) approach to avoid the subjectivity bias of observational methods in ergonomic assessments and further identify risk patterns for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among sewing machine operators. Methods: We proposed a decision tree analysis scheme for ergonomic assessment in working postures (DTAS-EAWP). First, DTAS-EAWP used computer vision-based technology to detect the body movement angles from the on-site working videos to generate a dataset of risk scores through the criteria of Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) for sewing machine operators. Second, data mining techniques (WEKA) using the C4.5 algorithm were used to construct a representative decision tree (RDT) with paths of various risk levels, and attribute importance analysis was performed to determine the critical body segments for WMSDs. Results: DTAS-EAWP was able to recognize 11,211 samples of continuous working postures in sewing machine operation and calculate the corresponding final REBA scores. A total of 13 decision rules were constructed in the RDT, with over 95% prediction accuracy and 83% path coverage, to depict the possible risk tendency in the working postures. Through RDT and attribute importance analysis, it was identified that the lower arm and the upper arms exhibited as critical segments that significantly increased the risk levels for WMSDs.

Further, there is growing interest in the use of smartphone sound level meter applications (apps) as an alternative to traditional noise measurement devices such as personal dosimeters. This research utilized a smartphone running the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) sound level meter app and a noise dosimeter to measure noise exposures in office, coffee shop, commuter train, restaurant, and spin class settings. Overall (N = 166), noise levels ranged from between 47.7 dBA and 42.6 dBA in the office setting to 101.2 dBA and 101.7 dBA in the spin class, for the smartphone and dosimeter, respectively.

70,Multi-class classification of construction hazards via cognitive states assessment using wearable EEG,"Jeon, JungHo and Cai, Hubo",To be synthesized from abstract,Problem described in context,Data described in abstract,Methods implied through analysis,Results summarized from abstract,"Improving workers’ safety and health is one of the most critical issues in the construction industry. Research attempts have been made to better identify construction hazards on a jobsite by analyzing workers’ physical responses (e.g., stride and balance) or physiological responses (e.g., brain waves and heart rate) collected from the wearable devices. Among them, electroencephalogram (EEG) holds unique potential since it reveals abnormal patterns immediately when a hazard is perceived and recognized. Unfortunately, the unproven capacity of EEG signals for multi-hazard classification is a primary barrier towards ubiquitous hazard identification in real-time on jobsites. This study correlates EEG signal patterns with construction hazard types and develops an EEG classifier based on the experiments conducted in an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment. Hazards of different types (e.g., fall and slip/trip) were simulated in a VR environment. EEG signals were collected from subjects who wore both wearable EEG and VR devices during the experimentation. Two types of EEG features (time-domain/frequency-domain features and cognitive features) were extracted for training and testing. A total of eighteen advanced machine learning algorithms were used to develop the EEG classifier. The initial results showed that the LightGBM classifier achieved 70.1% accuracy based on the cognitive feature set for the 7-class classification. To improve the performance, the input data was relabeled, and three strategies were designed and tested. As a result, the combined approach (two-step ensemble classification) achieved 82.3% accuracy. As such, this study not only demonstrates the feasibility of coupling wearable EEG, VR, and machine learning to differentiate jobsite hazards but also provides strategies to improve multi-class classification performance.

In the Swedish construction context, there is a desire to identify causes and factors playing a role in work-related accident prevention, as there are large underused databases of collected registrations that represent knowledge on causes and the context of accidents. The aim of the current contribution is to review the application of machine learning (ML) in the improved prevention of accidents and corresponding injuries, and to identify current limitations - and most importantly to answer the question of whether ML actually reveals more than what is currently known about accidents in construction. A systematic literature review on the use of ML for analysing data of accident records was carried out. In the reviewed literature, ML was applied in the prediction of accidents or their outcome, and the extraction or identification of the causes affecting the risks of injuries. ML combined with data mining (DM) techniques such as Natural Language Processing and graph mining, appears to be beneficial in discovering associations between different features and in multiple levels of clusters. However, the literature shows that research on ML in accident prevention is at an early stage. The review of the literature indicates gaps in the justification of methodological choices, such as the choice of ML method and data processing. Moreover, characteristics of the injury rates and severity are shown to be clashing with the mechanisms of the ML classification algorithms. This should probably lead to abandoning severity as a parameter and changing the approach towards the asymmetric data classes (denoted ""unbalanced""in ML methodology), leaving space for finding the important causes. An overreliance on internal validity testing and lack of external testing of the algorithms' performance and prediction accuracy persists. Future research needs to focus on methods addressing the problem of data processing, explaining the choice of methods, explaining the results (especially the variance in ML algorithm's performance), merging different data sources, considering more attributes (such as risk management), applying deep learning algorithms, and improving the testing accuracy of ML models. © 2020 Association of Researchers in Construction Management.",The aim of the study is to review the application of machine learning (ML) in improving accident prevention and to assess whether ML can reveal more than what is currently known about accidents in the construction industry.,"The persistent issue of occupational accidents in the construction industry, despite efforts to eliminate them, is a significant challenge.

For instance, while the injuries resulting in days away from work were substantially decreased, construction fatalities rose in the previous years. While previous safety fatality research work concentrated on studying how different variables could influence the number of fatalities in the construction industry, there is a lack of research efforts that studied the associations, interdependencies, and critical combinations between the different fatality causes. As such, to solve the critical fatality problem that the construction industry is facing, more advanced management methods should be applied. That said, this paper aims to address this important knowledge gap through a methodology based on data-driven computational algorithms. The data analyzed in this paper is comprised of 100 OSHA national fatal accident case files that are prepared by OSHA compliance officers. First, a reference matrix of 100 case files was constructed based on 60 causes that have shown to be the most pertinent to construction fatalities based on a previous study. Second, the spectral clustering computational algorithm was used to cluster the fatality causes based on the strength of their interconnectivities. Third, the frequent pattern data mining and Apriori algorithms were used to determine the critical combinations and associations of causes that mostly contribute to fatal accidents on construction sites. The findings indicate that the 60 fatality causes could be categorized into five clusters. Thus, the most critical combination of fatality causes was determined within each one of the identified clusters. Also, the findings reflected that while safety accidents could happen due to factors or causes that are individually critical, fatalities on construction sites could also result due to a combination of factors that might not be perceived to be critical on the individual level but rather become critical when combined with other factors. This study adds to the body of knowledge by proposing a data-driven accident causation approach to analyze construction fatality accidents, which adds a different dimension to the traditional analysis of safety accidents by factoring possible associations and combinations between different causes. That said, this paper equips safety professionals with a proactive approach that allows them to take the needed preventive actions to avoid fatalities on construction sites by identifying, in hindsight, the critical combinations and associations of fatality causes.

Among others, research has demonstrated that construction workers and professionals fail to recognize and manage an unacceptable number of safety hazards. To address this, past research has focused on examining several factors including training, education, and management support that may indirectly influence hazard identification and management performance. However, proximal factors associated with poor hazard identification and management at the work interface has received very little attention. This paper summarizes our research aimed at (1) understanding why workers fail to identify and manage safety hazards as they participate in hazard recognition and management efforts and; (2) developing evidence-based interventions to counter poor hazard identification and management performance in the construction industry. This includes examining hazard recognition as a visual search task and understanding how search pattern (i.e., how workers examine the work environment) affects hazard recognition performance. More specifically, the research used eye-tracking technology to examine the relationship between how workers examine the workplace and the resulting hazard identification performance. Based on this new knowledge generated, new interventions were developed to improve hazard recognition and management performance. These include two interventions. First, an immersive hyper-realistic mixed reality training environment that was developed using stereoscopic visual data captured from real construction workplaces. The testing of the intervention with 56 participants suggested that the intervention can significantly improve hazard identification and management performance. Second, an AI-based system that detects hazardous conditions and objects in real-time to assist workers and managers.

76,Modelling of the minimum ignition temperature (MIT) of corn dust using statistical analysis and artificial neural networks based on the synergistic effect of concentration and dispersion pressure,"Arshad, Ushtar and Taqvi, Syed Ali Ammar and Buang, Azizul",To be synthesized from abstract,Problem described in context,Data inferred from methods,Methods implied through analysis,Results summarized from abstract,"Corn dust is a highly energetic substance and frequently found in the food manufacturing industries. It not only poses occupational safety hazards such as suffocation or lung disorders for exposed persons but is often extremely explosible in ignition sensitive environment. This probability of explosion can be assessed and minimised with in-depth knowledge of controlling parameters/physical properties that trigger the ignition. This research takes into account the minimum ignition temperature (MIT), which is the control parameter for explosion risk assessment. MIT relies on multiple factors, such as moisture content, particle size, dust concentration, dispersion pressure, humidity and environmental temperature. In this study, the ignition of corn dust clouds was analysed using a Godbert Greenwald furnace for different combinations of dispersion pressure and concentrations. Test findings revealed that the minimum ignition temperature rises with a decrease in particle size. However, the minimum ignition temperature decreases with increased dispersion pressure and concentration until a specific value known as optimal value for ignition. Moreover, this work focuses on a statistical approach of polynomial surface fitting to forecast the MIT based on the combined impact of concentration and dispersion pressure on MIT for corn dust in a real-time experiment. The minimum value of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used to select the most appropriate polynomial model due to its authenticity and strong reputation. An artificial neural network (ANN) is also used as a predictive tool to develop a model that can forecast the MIT with a defined combination of dispersion pressures and corn dust concentrations. As soon as an appropriate estimation of this minimum ignition temperature of the combustible dust is confirmed, it is possible to ensure that the temperatures of the surrounding hot surfaces do not rise to that point to prevent the explosion. The predictive results obtained from ANN were found to be good when compared with the polynomial surface fit. Several models with different numbers of neurons have been trained with different transfer functions. For the training, validation, and test phases, R values are around 1.0, i.e., 0.9863, 0.9930, and 0.9893, respectively. The overall R value was 0.9875 for the proposed network. The findings were considered to be acceptable as the overall value of R was close to 1.0. The network obtained sufficiently comparable findings with the research conducted by Kasalova and Balog. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","The main purpose of this study was to assess and minimize the explosion risk of corn dust by determining the minimum ignition temperature (MIT) under various conditions, and to develop predictive models for MIT using polynomial surface fitting and artificial neural networks (ANN). ","Corn dust is a common and highly combustible substance in the food manufacturing industry that poses significant safety hazards, including the risk of explosions in ignition-sensitive environments. ","The study used experimental data obtained by analyzing the ignition of corn dust clouds in a Godbert Greenwald furnace, under different dispersion pressures and concentrations of corn dust. ",The study employed the following methods: 1. Determining the MIT for corn dust clouds under varying conditions using experimental setups. 2. Polynomial surface fitting to statistically forecast the MIT based on the impacts of concentration and dispersion pressure. 3. Utilization of artificial neural networks (ANN) as predictive tools to model MIT for specific conditions of dispersion pressures and concentrations. 4. Selection of the most appropriate polynomial model was based on the minimum value of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).,"Key findings include: 1. The MIT rises with a decrease in particle size and falls with increase in dispersion pressure and concentration until a critical value known as the optimal value for ignition. 2. Predictive results from the ANN were in good agreement with the polynomial surface fit and close to results obtained in previous research by Kasalova and Balog. 3. Several ANN models were trained using different numbers of neurons and transfer functions, showing high R-values (approximate to 1.0) in training, validation, and testing phases, which indicates high accuracy in the predictive capacity of the ANN model."

78,Utilizing safety rule correlation for mobile scaffolds monitoring leveraging deep convolution neural networks,"Khan, Numan and Saleem, Muhammad Rakeh and Lee, Doyeop and Park, Man-Woo and Park, Chansik",To be synthesized from abstract,Problem described in context,Data inferred from methods,Methods implied through analysis,Results summarized from abstract,"Falls from height (FFH) are still a leading cause of fatalities in the construction industry, which also includes scaffolding-related accidents. Despite regular safety inspections, numerous scaffolding-related accidents occur at the construction site. The current safety monitoring practices are not only impractical but infeasible due to dynamicity of construction environment. Since a separate computer training and detection process is generally required to acquire spatiotemporal reasoning to control a single hazard; thus previous efforts in vision intelligence applications to improve safety monitoring are still limited to specific hazards. Also, in regard to detecting unsafe situations based on extracted correlations from safety rules, to date, previous studies have devoted little attention to this domain. To address these issues, this study proposes a correlation-based approach for mobile scaffold safety monitoring and detecting worker's unsafe behaviors. A deep neural network, Mask R-CNN, was used as classification and segmentation of worker's tasks combined with object correlation detection (OCD) module to identify worker's unsafe behaviors.

Analysis of accident data has the potential to reveal insights that may improve capabilities to mitigate future accidents. However, because accident data are often transcribed textually, analyzing these narratives proves difficult. This study contributes to a recent stream of literature utilizing machine learning to automatically label accident narratives, converting them into more easily analyzable fields. Method: First, a large dataset of accident narratives in which workers were injured is collected from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Word embeddings-based text mining is implemented; compared to past works, this methodology offers excellent performance. Second, to improve the richness of analyses, each record is assessed across five dimensions. The machine learning models provide classifications of body part(s) injured, the source of the injury, the type of event causing the injury, whether a hospitalization occurred, and whether an amputation occurred.

84,Probabilistic Machine Learning with Low-Cost Sensor Networks for Occupational Exposure Assessment and Industrial Hygiene Decision Making,"Patton, Andrew N and Medvedovsky, Konstantin and Zuidema, Christopher and Peters, Thomas M and Koehler, Kirsten",To be synthesized from abstract,Problem described in context,Data described in abstract,Methods implied through analysis,Results inferred from discussion,"Occupational exposure assessments are dominated by small sample sizes and low spatial and temporal resolution with a focus on conducting Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulatory compliance sampling. However, this style of exposure assessment is likely to underestimate true exposures and their variability in sampled areas, and entirely fail to characterize exposures in unsampled areas. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has developed a more realistic system of exposure ratings based on estimating the 95th percentiles of the exposures that can be used to better represent exposure uncertainty and exposure variability for decision-making; however, the ratings can still fail to capture realistic exposure with small sample sizes. Therefore, low-cost sensor networks consisting of numerous lower-quality sensors have been used to measure occupational exposures at a high spatiotemporal scale. However, the sensors must be calibrated in the laboratory or field to a reference standard. Using data from carbon monoxide (CO) sensors deployed in a heavy equipment manufacturing facility for eight months from August 2017 to March 2018, we demonstrate that machine learning with probabilistic gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) can model raw sensor readings to reference data highly accurately, entirely removing the need for laboratory calibration. Further, we indicate how the machine learning models can produce probabilistic hazard maps of the manufacturing floor, creating a visual tool for assessing facility-wide exposures. Additionally, the ability to have a fully modeled prediction distribution for each measurement enables the use of the AIHA exposure ratings, which provide an enhanced industrial decision-making framework as opposed to simply determining if a small number of measurements were above or below a pertinent occupational exposure limit. Lastly, we show how a probabilistic modeling exposure assessment with high spatiotemporal resolution data can prevent exposure misclassifications associated with traditional models that rely exclusively on mean or point predictions. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

This study sought to evaluate whether the NIOCCS algorithm was sufficiently robust with low-quality inputs and how variable quality could impact subsequent job estimated exposures in a large job-exposure matrix for noise (NoiseJEM). Using free-text industry and job descriptions from >700,000 noise measurements in the NoiseJEM, three files were created and input into NIOCCS: (1) N1, “raw” industries and job titles; (2) N2, “refined” industries and “raw” job titles; and (3) N3, “refined” industries and job titles. Standardized industry and occupation codes were output by NIOCCS. Descriptive statistics of performance metrics (e.g., misclassification/discordance of occupation codes) were evaluated for each input relative to the original NoiseJEM dataset (N0). Across major Standardized Occupational Classifications (SOC), total discordance rates for N1, N2, and N3 compared to N0 were 53.6%, 42.3%, and 5.0%, respectively.

N2 had the most accurate noise exposure estimates (i.e., smallest bias) across major SOC groups compared to N1 and N3. Further refinement of job titles in N3 showed little improvement. Some variation in classification efficacy was seen over time, particularly prior to 1985. Machine learning algorithms can systematically and consistently classify data but are highly dependent on the quality and amount of input data.

89,MetaInjury: Meta-learning framework for reusing the risk knowledge of different construction accidents,"Li, Xin and Zhu, Rongchen and Ye, Han and Jiang, Chunxiao and Benslimane, Abderrahim",To be synthesized from abstract,Problem described in context,Data described in abstract,Methods described in abstract,Results summarized from abstract,"In recent years, many scholars have used data mining algorithms to discover the laws related to the prevention of occupational injuries in the construction industry. Using accident injury records to model occupational risk is a promising direction (for example, predict injury risk from accident frequency and severity). However, the records of specific accident injury data are relatively limited, bringing great difficulties for people to obtain risk knowledge and establish an effective accident consequence prediction model. This article proposes a meta-learning framework called MetaInjury, which can help safety managers share risk knowledge and predict the risk of work-related injuries in various construction industry accidents. When facing small sample data of a new accident type, we first calculate the document vector of the accident description and compare its center vector with vectors in the Meta-knowledge database to find the type of accident most similar. Then, we correspond the meta-features with the best machine learning algorithms on the data set to implement the recommendation of accident prediction algorithms. Through finding the most similar cases and the recommended algorithm, important accident risk factors and accident assessment rules can be shared by safety managers to realize effective risk management. Moreover, specific small sample accident consequences can be predicted by the recommended algorithm. Finally, we verify the method's effectiveness in four different small sample accident data. The results show that the MetaInjury framework can provide theoretical support for preventing small sample accidents and injury reduction in the construction industry. © 2021","The main purpose of this study was to develop a meta-learning framework called MetaInjury to enhance the ability to share risk knowledge and predict the risk of work-related injuries in various construction industry accidents, especially when dealing with small sample data of new accident types.

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in occupational safety in the construction industry. However, all the current methods using conventional machine learning with stationary cameras suffer from some severe limitations, perceptual aliasing (e.g., different places/objects can appear identical), occlusion (e.g., place/object appearance changes between visits), seasonal / illumination changes, significant viewpoint changes, etc. This paper proposes a perception module using end-to-end deep-learning and visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for an effective and efficient object recognition and navigation using a differential-drive mobile robot.

93,Machine Learning-Based Risk Analysis for Construction Worker Safety from Ubiquitous Site Photos and Videos,"Tang, Shuai and Golparvar-Fard, Mani",To be synthesized from abstract,Problem described in context,Data described in abstract,Methods described in abstract,Results inferred from discussion,"This paper proposes a new method for single-worker severity level prediction from already collected site images and video clips. Onsite safety observers often assess workers' severity levels during construction activities. While risk analysis is key to improving long-term construction site safety, omnipresent monitoring is still time-consuming and costly to implement. The recent growth of visual data captured actively on construction sites has opened a new opportunity to increase the frequency of worker safety monitoring. This paper shows that a comprehensive vision-based assessment is the most informative to automatically infer worker severity level from images. Efficient computer vision models are presented to conduct this risk analysis. The method is validated on a challenging image dataset first of its kind. Specifically, the proposed method detects and evaluates the worker state from visual data, defined by (1) worker body posture, (2) the usage of personal protective equipment, (3) worker interactions with tools and materials, (4) the construction activity being performed, and (5) the presence of surrounding workplace hazards. To estimate the worker state, a multitasked recognition model is introduced that recognizes objects, activity, and keypoints from visual data simultaneously, taking 36.6% less time and 40.1% less memory while keeping comparably performances compared to a system running individual models for each subtask. Worker activity recognition is further improved with a spatio-temporal graph neural network model using recognized per-frame worker activity, detected bounding boxes of tools and materials, and estimated worker poses. Finally, severity levels are predicted by a trained classifier on a dataset of images of construction workers accompanied with ground truth severity level annotations.

It is clear that the chemical materials u",Problem described in context,Data described in abstract,Methods described in abstract,Results summarized from abstract,"Background and aims: In recent decades, air quality in different work environments has been a major concern. It is clear that the chemical materials used in industries have a profound effect on the quality of workplace air. In 1942, the number of identified chemicals was about 600,000, in 1947 it was about 4 million, and in 2011 it was about 18 million, while the number of new chemical compounds increased from 1,000 to 2,000 annually. Many people around the world are exposed to a variety of chemicals in various working environment. Exposure to these substances can lead to numerous health and carcinogenic effects on individuals. Among these substances, volatile organic compounds are one of the main contributors to air pollution and due to high vapor pressure, high evaporation rate and rapid release into the environment, many people are exposed and consequently have irreversible effects on their health in various occupations. Petrochemical industry is one of the industries where workers are exposed to high levels of chemical pollutants in their respiratory air. One of the hazardous volatile organic compounds used in workplaces, including petrochemicals, is 1,3-butadiene (molecular formula: C4H6). 1,3-Butadiene is a colorless gas with smells like gasoline. Many international agencies and government organizations, including the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), have identified this chemical as a human carcinogen by inhalation and placed it in Group 1 of carcinogens. Health effects of this compound include stimulation of the nervous system, eyes, nose, airways, asthma, fatigue, low blood pressure, and heart rate as well as atrophy in the ovaries. Today, many international organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), consider the use of quantitative risk assessment methods as the legal basis for chemical compounds. Generally, the health risk assessment process involves several steps. First, it identify the existing hazards, then measuring the individual's exposure, finally determining the relevant factors and measuring and evaluating the individual's exposure to a particular substance. Afterwards, using different risk assessment methods, graphs and dose-response values, the probability of adverse effects in the population is calculated. Therefore, due to the deleterious effects of the 1,3- butadiene on the health of those working in the petrochemical industry, and the lack of similar studies in Iran to assess the health risk of the respiratory exposure to 1,3-butadiene in the petrochemical industry, the present study aimed to assess the health risk of occupational exposure to 1,3-butadiene vapors in a petrochemical industry in Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the petrochemical industry that produce copolymer ABS (acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene) in Iran in 2018. In order to determine the respiratory exposure of participants to 1,3-butadiene, NIOSH 1024 method was used. Samples were collected by surface adsorption using adsorbent tubes containing activated charcoal of coconut (600 mg) and manufactured by SKC UK. It should be noted that similar exposure groups were used to assess individual exposure. Sample Size for research according to the proposed model of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (SEG) and based on to the number of workers in each occupational exposure group, were estimated 150 samples of 50 workers' respiratory air. At the sampling site, both sides of the sampling tube were broken and connected to an individual sampling pump made by SKC and calibrated using a soap bubble flow meter at a flow rate of 200 ml/min according to the sampling method. After sampling, the content of activated charcoal in both front (400 mg) and rear (200 mg) sections of the sample tube was transferred to separate 5-ml vials. Then, by using the optimal NIOSH 1024 method, the extraction of the analyte was carried out by using 4-ml methylene chloride as an extraction solvent. Finally, 1μl of the sample with a 10μl gas-tight syringe manufactured by Hamilton Company was injected into the Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) (model CP-3800 gas chromatograph and FID detector, Varian Technologies, Japan). Assessment of occupational exposure to 1,3-butadiene: In the present study, the occupational exposure limit for 1,3-butadiene (TLV - TWA) was 2 ppm (4.42 mg/m3) based on values reported by the American Conference of governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). In the present study, occupational exposure index was calculated for each individual. Because the TLV-TWA values are provided with the assumption of working 8-hours a day and 5-days per week, if the working hours per week were more than 40 hours, the TLV-TWA value was corrected by using the Brief and Scala model. health risk assessment of occupational exposure to 1,3-butadiene: The quantitative risk assessment methodology proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has been used to assess the health risk of exposure to 1,3-butadiene. Hazard Quotient (HQ) index was used to calculate the health risk of occupational exposure to 1,3-butadiene. Health risk is defined as the ratio of chronic daily intake for non-carcinogenic effects to the reference dose. Chronic daily intake (CDI) indicates exposure to a mass of matter per unit of body weight and time in a relatively long period. Inhalation reference dose was derived from the inhalation reference concentration (RfC). Inhalation reference concentration was 2 × 10-3 mg.m-3for 1,3-butadiene according to Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) databank. In the present study, information such as exposure duration, body weight, exposure time, and exposure frequency were collected by means of a questionnaire. The average inhalation rate ranged from 15.7 to 16 cubic meters per day depending on the age of the participants, according to the values presented in the EPA exposure factors handbook. The average lifetime was 70 years. Finally, data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and frequency) were presented. Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used at the significant level of 0.05. Results: The mean respiratory exposure to 1,3-butadiene during work shift among all participants was 560.82 ± 811.36 µg.m-3 and in all cases it was below the corrected occupational exposure limit based on job characteristics. Also, the mean exposure index among all subjects was calculated to be 0.198 ± 0.25 and in all cases, it was lower than the permitted level. The results showed that the highest average respiratory exposure was in the safety and fire-fighting station worker. The average concentration of 1,3-butadiene in the workers' respiratory air in the safety and fire-fighting station was 1791.42 μg.m-3. After the safety and fire-fighting station workers, the highest average concentration of 1,3-butadiene was in the respiratory air of workers in the dryer, compound 1, laboratory, poly-butadiene latex and compound 2 units with exposure index values of 0.38, 0.277, 0.256, 0.223 and 0.189, respectively. Mean and standard deviation of hazard quotient among all participants was 10.82 ±14.76. It was found that 60% of all exposed workers were in the unacceptable health risk level and 40% were in the acceptable risk level. The highest average of HQ was related to the safety and fire-fighting station workers with a value of 36.57. After the mentioned unit, the highest value of calculated HQ was observed in the dryer, laboratory, compound 2, installation and compound 1 with the values of 18.51, 16.01, 12.23, 11.57and 10.82 respectively. The lowest HQ in the present study was obtained in the workers of packing, mechanical repair and coagulation units with the values of 0.18, 0.58 and 1.39 respectively. Among all examined units, the average non-carcinogenic risk values in the packing and mechanical repair units were lower than the permissible limit (HQ < 1.0). Conclusion: The results of the present study demonstrated that the health risks associated with exposure to 1,3-butadiene in most of the workers (60%) were in the unacceptable health risk level. Therefore, application of suitable control strategies such as design and implementation of appropriate dilution and local ventilation systems due to the non-standardization of all existing ventilation systems in the industry to reduce the level of respiratory exposure of workersto1,3-butadiene vapors and consequently, the reduction in the amount of health risk caused by exposure to this compound and the use of quantitative health risk assessment methods as a basis for judging the levels of respiratory exposure to hazardous compounds (especially carcinogens due to their high potential risk rates) and prioritizing the various units for the control measures is absolutely essential. © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires construction companies through safety laws to ensure the use of well-defined personal protective equipment (PPE). It has long been a problem to ensure the use of PPE because round-the-clock human monitoring is not possible. However, such monitoring through technological aids or automated tools is very much possible. The present study describes a systema-tic strategy based on deep learning (DL) models built on the You-Only-Look-Once (YOLOV5) architecture that could be used for monitoring workers’ hard hats in real-time. It can indicate whether a worker is wearing a hat or not. The proposed system uses five different models of the YOLOV5, namely YOLOV5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5 m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x for object detection with the support of PyTorch, involving 7063 images. The results of the study show that among the DL models, the YOLOV5x has a high performance of 95.8% in terms of the mAP, while the YOLOV5n has the fastest detection speed of 70.4 frames per second (FPS). The proposed model can be successfully used in practice to recognize the hard hat worn by a worker. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

For safety risks such as improper operations or unsafe facilities, the government will take an on-site record and then send formal rectification notices to the contractor to improve the safety condition in time.

The existing data on the toxicity of inhaled nanomaterials in animal models is sparse in comparison to the number of potential factors that may contribute to or aggravate nanomaterial toxicity, limiting the power of conventional statistical analysis to detect property/toxicity relationships. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that exhaustive chemical and physical characterization of all nanomaterial attributes in these studies is rare, due to resource or equipment constraints and dissimilar investigator priorities. This paper presents risk assessment models developed through a meta-analysis of in vivo nanomaterial rodentinhalational toxicity studies. We apply machine learning techniques including regression trees and the related ensemble method, random forests in order to determine the relative contribution of different physical and chemical attributes on observed toxicity. These methods permit the use of data records with missing information without substituting presumed values and can reveal complex data relationships even in nonlinear contexts or conditional situations. Based on this analysis, we present a predictive risk model for the severity of inhaled nanomaterial toxicity based on a given set of nanomaterial attributes. This model reveals the anticipated change in the expected toxic response to choices of nanomaterial design (such as physical dimensions or chemical makeup). This methodology is intended to aid nanomaterial designers in identifying nanomaterial attributes that contribute to toxicity, giving them the opportunity to substitute safer variants while continuing to meet functional objectives. Findings from this analysis indicate that carbon nanotube (CNT) impurities explain at most 30% of the variance pulmonary toxicity as measured by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) count. Titanium dioxide nanoparticle size and aggregation affected the observed toxic response by less than ±10%. Difference in observed effects for a group of metal oxide nanoparticle associated with differences in Gibbs Free Energy on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations amount to only 4% to the total variance. Other chemical descriptors of metal oxides were unimportant.

In addition, there are many cases that workers carry out a task or pass through without knowing risk of the task or risk of the area to be worked. It is difficult for each individual worker to know various surrounding circumstances, and there are also limitations in that safety supervisors play a role of safety management for all worksites.

Commercial grain elevators are hazardous agro-manufacturing work environments where workers are prone to severe injuries, due to the nature of the activities and workplace. Safety incidents in agro-manufacturing operations generally arise from a combination of factors, rather than a single cause, therefore, research on occupational incidents must look deeper into identifying the underlying causes, through the application of advanced analyses methods. In occupational safety, it is possible to estimate and predict probability of safety risks through developing artificial neural network predictive models. Due to the significance of safety risk assessment in the design and prioritization of effective prevention measures, this study aimed at classifying and predicting causes of occupational incidents in grain elevator agro-manufacturing operations in the Midwest region of the United States. Workers' compensation claims data, from 2008 to 2016, were utilized for training multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. Both MLP and RBF models could predict the probability of safety risks with a high overall accuracy of 60%, 61%. Based on values of AUC (area under the curve) from the ROC (receiving operating charts), both models predicted the probability of individual safety risks with a high accuracy rate of between 71.5% and 99.2%.

The physical and mental health of steel workers is related to the development of China's steel industry. Steel workers have long been working in shifts, high temperatures, noise, highly stressed, and first-line environments. These occupational related factors have an impact on the health of steel workers. At present, the existing hypertension risk scoring models do not include occupational related factors, so they are not applicable to the risk score of hypertension in steel workers. It is necessary to establish a risk scoring model for hypertension in steel workers. In this study, the learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network algorithm and the Fisher-SVM coupling algorithm are applied to estimate the hypertension risk of steel workers, and the microscopic laws of the 'tailing' phenomenon of the two algorithms are analyzed by means of graphics analysis, which can describe the influence trend of sample size change in different intervals on the classification effect. The results show that the classification accuracy of the algorithm depends on the size of the sample space. When the sample size n ≤ 30 ∗ (k + 1), the Fisher-SVM coupling intelligent algorithm is more applicable. Because its average accuracy rate is 90.00%, the average accuracy of the LVQ algorithm is only 63.34%. When the sample size is n > 30 ∗ (k + 1), the LVQ algorithm is more applicable. Because its average accuracy rate is 93.33%, the average accuracy of the Fisher-SVM coupling intelligent algorithm is only 76.67%.

174,Data mining mine safety data,"Dessureault, S. and Sinuhaji, A. and Coleman, P.",To be synthesized from abstract,Problem described in context,Data described in abstract,Methods implied through analysis,Results summarized from abstract,"The U.S. Mine Safety and Heath Administration (MSHA) developed a mine accident database from Part 50 of the Federal mine safety regulations. This database is a valuable resource for keeping track of the numbers, rates and severity of mine accidents in the United States. Epidemiologists and mine safety researchers have used it to perform many analyses, helping to guide research and bestpractices. Database technology has changed from when the database was originally designed in the early 1980s. Contemporary analytic databases, typically called data warehouses, focus on table structure to facilitate integrating many different data sources for the purpose of applying analysis and visualization tools to gain more in-depth knowledge. In early 2006, the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) funded an exploratory research project to evaluate the potential benefits of reengineering the MSHA Part 50 data into a data warehouse environment and to assess the potential of data mining to give new insight. This paper explores the background of the Part 50 database, gives a general background of data warehousing and data mining, and presents some of the interesting analyses that resulted from a modernized Part 50 data warehouse using data mining.",The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential benefits of reengineering the Mine Safety and Heath Administration's (MSHA) Part 50 accident database into a data warehouse environment and assess the potential of data mining techniques for gaining new insights.,The primary challenge addressed was the outdated technology of the original MSHA Part 50 database and the need to integrate it with modern data analysis and visualization tools to improve mine safety research.,"The study utilized the MSHA Part 50 accident database, which contains records of mine accidents, including numbers, rates, and severity from the U.S. mining industry.

175,Evaluation of an artificial intelligence program for estimating occupational exposures,"Johnston, Karen L. and Phillips, Margaret L. and Esmen, Nurtan A. and Hall, Thomas A.",To be synthesized from abstract,Problem described in context,Data described in abstract,Methods implied through analysis,Results summarized from abstract,"Estimation and Assessment of Substance Exposure (EASE) is an artificial intelligence program developed by UK's Health and Safety Executive to assess exposure. EASE computes estimated airborne concentrations based on a substance's vapor pressure and the types of controls in the work area. Though EASE is intended only to make broad predictions of exposure from occupational environments, some occupational hygienists might attempt to use EASE for individual exposure characterizations. This study investigated whether EASE would accurately predict actual sampling results from a chemical manufacturing process. Personal breathing zone time-weighted average (TWA) monitoring data for two volatile organic chemicals-a common solvent (toluene) and a specialty monomer (chloroprene)-present in this manufacturing process were compared to EASE-generated estimates. EASE-estimated concentrations for specific tasks were weighted by task durations reported in the monitoring record to yield TWA estimates from EASE that could be directly compared to the measured TWA data. Two hundred and six chloroprene and toluene full-shift personal samples were selected from eight areas of this manufacturing process. The Spearman correlation between EASE TWA estimates and measured TWA values was 0.55 for chloroprene and 0.44 for toluene, indicating moderate predictive values for both compounds. For toluene, the interquartile range of EASE estimates at least partially overlapped the interquartile range of the measured data distributions in all process areas. The interquartile range of EASE estimates for chloroprene fell above the interquartile range of the measured data distributions in one process area, partially overlapped the third quartile of the measured data in five process areas and fell within the interquartile range in two process areas. EASE is not a substitute for actual exposure monitoring. However, EASE can be used in conditions that cannot otherwise be sampled and in preliminary exposure assessment if it is recognized that the actual interquartile range could be much wider and/or offset by a factor of 10 or more. © 2004 British Occupational Hygiene Society.",The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether the Estimation and Assessment of Substance Exposure (EASE) artificial intelligence program could accurately predict actual sampling results of airborne concentrations of specific chemicals in a chemical manufacturing process.,"The problem addressed in this study is that while EASE is designed to make general predictions of occupational environmental exposure, it was unclear if it could accurately determine individual exposure characterizations for specific tasks in real-world settings. ","The data used in the study included personal breathing zone time-weighted average (TWA) monitoring data for two volatile organic chemicals—toluene and chloroprene—from a chemical manufacturing process. Specifically, two hundred and six full-shift personal samples of chloroprene and toluene collected from eight different areas within the manufacturing process were utilized. ","The study involved comparing the TWA estimates generated by EASE, which were weighted by task durations as reported in monitoring records, with the measured TWA data. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the EASE-generated estimates and the actual measured values. ","The results demonstrated moderate predictive accuracy of EASE, with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.55 for chloroprene and 0.44 for toluene. While the interquartile range of EASE estimates for toluene partially overlapped with the interquartile range of the measured data across all process areas, the EASE estimates for chloroprene were less consistent and varied more across different process areas. The study concluded that EASE should not replace actual exposure monitoring but could still serve useful in preliminary exposure assessments and in scenarios where direct sampling is not feasible."
176,"CBR research using the 'think', 'plan', 'do' classification method","Campbell, Jennifer M. and Smith, Simon D.",To be synthesized from abstract,Problem described in context,Data inferred from methods,Methods described in abstract,Results summarized from abstract,"Recent skill shortages in the UK Construction Industry have undoubtedly lead to a loss of tacit knowledge and experience. In addition, clients' need for greater value and better construction services results in companies striving for competitive advantage by becoming more efficient in the way they manage their knowledge systems and resources. Although Case-based reasoning (CBR) originated in artificial intelligence research, it has transcended barriers between technology and methodology to become applicable in many industrial and research fields. Research and applications have shown CBR can emulate human reasoning and decision making processes and as such a wide variety of construction tasks have been used in case studies. Furthermore, CBR applications may cover many areas of a project life cycle, but the extent of coverage was generally unknown. By mapping an innovative three-stage classification method to the accepted model of a project life cycle, past CBR research can be grouped and inspected. This 'think', 'plan, and 'do' classification method has shown imbalance of CBR research applications within the construction industry with little aid to those involved in the 'doing' phases. The 'think', 'plan', 'do' classification method has identified potential areas where the further application of CBR may prove useful within infrastructure management, and in particular within an educational role for safety and risk management.",The main purpose of this study was to explore how Case-based Reasoning (CBR) could be effectively mapped across different stages of the project life cycle in the construction industry to improve knowledge management and decision-making processes.,"The study addresses the challenge of skill shortages and loss of tacit knowledge in the UK Construction Industry, alongside the need for companies to enhance efficiency and gain competitive advantage by better managing their knowledge systems.
